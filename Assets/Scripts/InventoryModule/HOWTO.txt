Hello!

This is an Inventory System Module, primarily used to hold and use customized items!

How To Use:
1. Drag The Component<Item> (from /Scripts/InventoryModule/Component/Item) Onto A GameObject of your choice 
2. Set Up The Values For The Basic Component
3. Select One Of The Behaviours and configure it accordingly

[IMPORTANT NOTE!]: If you ever create your own Behaviour Scripts Make sure that any internal variables are Serialized as well

Play IT!

Adding New Behaviours
Part I: Creating The Behaviour
1. Create a new class, dont forget to extend A_ItemBehaviour (Remember you can use all the normal Unity Functions as well)
2. All variables must be serialized to save persistant data when moving from Play to Editor and vice versa.
3. YOU MUST Populate The Initialize() and ItemAction() with code, Initialize will act as a normal copy Constuctor, normaly OnEventTrigger will change the Abstract Bool To True (named EventTrigger) with any extra code you may need(usually used Only When You Hve Update Code).

PartII: Adding It To The Custom Inspector
1. Create entry in ENUM of ItemEditor (from /Scripts/InventoryModule/Component/Item)
2. Add a new function within the region near the end of the code(from /Scripts/InventoryModule/Editor/ItemEditor), inside write some Inspector Code to show the correct variables that need to be set up.
3. Add a new entry to the switch case at the end of the OnInspectorGUI() following its structure
